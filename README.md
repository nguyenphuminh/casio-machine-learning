## Casio Machine Learning

This repo contains documents related to performing machine learning algorithms on **scientific calculators, not programmable models**, specifically the models with Spreadsheet support, like the Casio fx-880btg, the Casio fx-991ex, and other models alike.

### ...why?

I'm currently doing AI stuff a lot and I love working with heavily constrained environments, and the closest thing I have with me on a daily basis is a Casio scientific calculator :).
